## Build
// `npm i` to install all necessary modules
// Need "mocha" installed globaly (in terminal `mocha -V` to verify its installed)
// `npm start` to start a server
// `npm test` to start test (test timeout is 65 sec). Server have to be on,
for testing.

## About:
I used 3rd part of library for rateLimit with IP, and simple added to IP-identifier
req.params, for create unique key and track requests.
Thank you for viewing.
